# **Build using Shadow Drive and RPC**

## **Shadow Drive**

### **To get started with the CLI:**  
1. [Install NodeJS LTS 16.17.1](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)  
2. Install the [Shadow Drive CLI](/build/shadow-drive/README.md)
3. Follow the [CLI Guide](/build/shadow-drive/the-cli.md)
    * After installing Solana, **make sure you have both SHDW and SOL in your wallet in order to reserve storage**.

### **To get started with the SDKs:**
1. [Javascript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@shadow-drive/sdk), [Rust](https://crates.io/crates/shadow-drive-rust), and [Python](https://github.com/GenesysGo/shadow-drive-rust/tree/main/py) are your choices.
2. Follow the [SDK Guide](/build/shadow-drive/the-sdk.md)
    * You can build directly on top of the [API](shadow-drive/the-api.md).  
    * Tell us about your project in our [Disord](https://discord.gg/genesysgo) so we can publish to the community. See others [here](shadow-drive/community-mainted-uis.md).

## **Shadow RPC**

### **To get started with Shadow RPC:**
1. Choose a subscription. The [Premium](shadow-rpc/README.md) subscription is easy, low cost, and a common choice for many. Or you can try a [Free Account](shadow-rpc/reserve-shadow-rpc-account.md)!
2. Use our [Portal](https://portal.genesysgo.net/premium/reserve) to sign-up. 
    * **You will need USDC and SOL in your wallet** to complete the reservation. 
    * Subscriptions to services work on 30 days cycles.
3. Choose your authentication
    * We support the easier [API URL key](shadow-rpc/authentication.md) implementation, or if you prefer the [JWT token](shadow-rpc/authentication.md) authentication methods.
