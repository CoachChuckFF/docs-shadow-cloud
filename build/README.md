## Shadow Drive

* **To get started - [Install NodeJS LTS 16.17.1](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)**
* **Next, install the [Shadow Drive CLI](/build/shadow-drive/README.md)**
    * After installing Solana, **make sure you have both SHDW and SOL in your wallet in order to reserve storage**.
    * For deeper application integration use the [SDK](shadow-drive/the-sdk.md) availble in both [JavaScript/Typescript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@shadow-drive/sdk) as well as [Rust](https://crates.io/crates/shadow-drive-rust).

    * You can build directly on top of the [API](shadow-drive/the-api.md).
    * Commmunity mainted UIs and apps currently using Shadow Drives are [here](shadow-drive/community-mainted-uis.md).


## Shadow RPC

* **To get started, consider the [Premium](shadow-rpc/README.md) subscription. It is easy, low cost, and a common choice for many.**
* **Or try a [Free Account](shadow-rpc/reserve-shadow-rpc-account.md) right away and test everything out!**
    * Our offerings outshine our competitors on rate limits given the cost, and provides automatic global load balancing (GEO-DNS routing) natively.

    * Use our [Portal](https://portal.genesysgo.net/premium/reserve) to sign-up. **You will need USDC and SOL in your wallet** to complete the reservation. Subscriptions to services work on 30 days cycles.

    * [Browse all tiers](shadow-rpc/README.md)

    * We support the quicker [API URL key](shadow-rpc/authentication.md) implemenation, or if you prefer the [JWT token](shadow-rpc/authentication.md) authentication methods so that you can use your paid plan as quickly as possible.
