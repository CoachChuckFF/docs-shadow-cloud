# RPC Subscribers

### So you're developing the greatest Solana dApp ever...

You're off to a great start by choosing the only highly performant decentralized RPC network. Other RPC networks force you to choose between performance or decentralization. The Shadow RPC network provides all the benefits of decentralization without sacrificing speed, stability, or security.

One of the things that you will find out really quickly is that when your end user clicks the "Submit" button in their wallet, your app will need to build a transaction and send it to an RPC. Furthermore, if your application is thriving with users you will find their activity generates huge read-loads and consistly high throughput that needs horizontal back-end elasticity. If you try to rely on public, free RPCs, your dApp will crash and burn the first time it comes under any sort of of load.

Built on a network of independent operators, Shadowâ€™s Solana RPCs truly decentralize your back-end API with payments for compute going directly to ecosystem operators.
