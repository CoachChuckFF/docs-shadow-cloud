# KYC - Know Your Cloud

## The Basics of Shadow Cloud

Software developers need compute and storage. They need a server to host their next generation, paradigm shifting dApp. They also need storage to do the obvious - store data. Public clouds give developers just that - the ability to spin up servers and storage on demand.

So software developers have a demand, but who has the supply? Public cloud providers do. They literally created the cloud about a decade ago just because they had so much spare compute laying around and thought "why not monetize this? Let's just rent out these servers and try to recoup the cost." As they got better and better at scaling their operation, better options became available.&#x20;

Now cloud compute makes up $400,000,000,000 (thats billion with a B) per year business, and is expected to increase by another $1T by 2030.&#x20;

**But what about us? We, the people, have plenty of spare compute just laying around, don't we? We also have the skills to deploy compute. Could WE service some of that demand?**

So in order to make Shadow Cloud become an actual thing, we need to break it apart into the basics. We need:

* A way to collect payment - that's where DLT technology comes in
* A way to validate the payment as well as the compute request - **that's DAGGER** (more to come)
* A way to add new nodes or remove old nodes to the compute network - another thing DAGGER does
* A wau to orchestrate an qualiture assure resources of the decentralized network - DAGGER and then some other magic

Your big takeaway is this: _**DAGGER is the heartbeat of Shadow Cloud**_. It is the decentralizor and orchestrator.
