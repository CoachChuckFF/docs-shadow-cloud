# Shadow Cloud

## Mission

The Shadow Platform will continually evolve as a stable high-performance cloud platform powered by a decentralized network of operators. Shadow is the only commodity cloud network designed to democratize the hundreds of billions earned each year by traditional cloud platforms without sacrificing performance. Through thoughful design, the Shadow Cloud will offer multiple service options which leverage our distributed ledger technology. This will empower the use of decentralization through compute and storage offering for when it makes sense, while offering builders and business options and the ability to customize our solutions to achieve their desired degree of web3 versus web2 implenenations. 

## The Basics of Shadow Cloud
The Shadow Ecosystem is a series of trustless permissionless infrastructure layers focused on decentralizing the web2 stack and adapting it for the web3 world. We call this core technology D.A.G.G.E.R. Powered by Shadow Operators, the network provides builders and businesses with storage and compute soltions to expand their web3 presence, or simply use some of the most highly performant distributed ledger technology for it's low cost and resiliency in business.

Now cloud compute makes up $400,000,000,000 (thats billion with a B) per year business, and is expected to increase by another $1T by 2030.

The Shadow Platform is a stable high-performance cloud platform powered by a decentralized network of operators. Unlike traditional cloud platforms, network-generated revenues are sent to Shadow Operators. Shadow is the only commodity cloud network designed to democratize the hundreds of billions earned each year by traditional cloud platforms without sacrificing performance.

In order execute this trustless decentralized network we built our own highly peroformant consensus and orchetration protocol called D.A.G.G.E.R. Your takeaway is this: _**DAGGER is the heartbeat of Shadow Cloud**_. It is the decentralizor and orchestrator.

### D.A.G.G.E.R.
The foundation the Shadow Ecosystem is D.A.G.G.E.R., a trustless decentralized consensus protocol that expands the Shadow Cloud platform beyond standard compute and storage offerings, enabling decentralized offerings of compute, mobile compute, and decentralized storage - all while pushing the limits of performance, quality, and security. D.A.G.G.E.R. stands for Directed Acyclic Gossip Graph Enabling Replication (of compute and storage).

### Storage
The Shadow Cloud storage implementaion of D.A.G.G.E.R. - known as Shadow Drive - is currenlty optimized for the Solana blockchain. The Ecosystem is powered by a network of independent Shadow Operators who contribute compute and storage resources to the decentralized network. 

Shadow Drive is decentralized, performant, and scalable object storage designed for Web3 builders. Integrate blockchain tech into your business or project with a storage solution that's resilient, secure, and built to scale.

### Compute
Built on a network of independent operators, Shadow’s Solana RPCs truly decentralize your back-end API with payments for compute going directly to ecosystem operators. Upgrade your back-end API to fit a Web3 ethos while still benefiting from resiliency, performance, and affordability.

### Shadow Operators
Shadow Operators are the decentralized backbone of the Shadow commodity cloud. Operators lease their high-performance compute, storage, and bandwidth. Businesses, projects, and/or individual developers can trustlessly provision network resources. User payments are sent directly to Shadow Operators. Shadow Operators who ensure their resources are always available and performant earn more. Shadow Operators who are inconsistent earn less.

At the foundation of everything are the Shadow Operators who run the nodes that power the Shadow Platform. Operators can connect new nodes to the network, manage their existing servers, or view the overall status of other Shadow Operators – all through the one easy-to-use portal.

### Business Use Cases for Shadow Cloud

* Storage
    * Web hosting & content management
        * Managing static content at high volumes that can elastically scale with your needs makes Shadow Drive a great solution for web content, media, images, and other unstructured data types.
    * Social media
        * Temporarily or permanently store message history and embedded media, stream video content from user uploads, and store and deliver vast amounts of images and avatars to enhance the Web3 efficacy of your app.
    * Archival & back-up
        * By 3x replicating and erasure coding encrypted records across a decentralized network, Shadow Drive can preserve valuable records from bad actors.
    * Datasets
        * Some information is too important for humanity to lose. From scientific research projects to historical documentation, cryptographic proofs guarantee a dataset’s integrity and availability forever. Imagine if the world’s most important libraries couldn’t be destroyed because the information has been distributed across thousands of unique locations worldwide.
    * Personal & editable storage space
        * With optional mutability, you are free to create and delete files as you see fit. With low costs and many front-end user interfaces to choose from, Shadow Drive can be your personal expanded storage space.
* Compute
    * Application Building
        * Delivery on-chain data to front-end business applications with speed and reliability.
    * Mobile Development
        * Power back-end mobile remote procedural calls to enable users to ineract with their favorite blockchain or web3 mobile application.
    * Enterprise VMs
        * White-glove handlnig of baremetal and virtual provisioning for specialied distributed ledger technology implementatations
