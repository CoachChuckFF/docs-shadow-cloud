## **Mission**

Our mission is to continually evolve a stable high-performance Shadow Cloud Platform powered by a decentralized network of operators. Shadow is the only commodity cloud network designed to democratize the hundreds of billions earned each year by traditional cloud platforms without sacrificing performance. Through thoughtful design, the Shadow Cloud will offer multiple service options which leverage our distributed ledger technology. The result is vertically integrated, L1-specific storage and compute offering that greatly improves developer experience. This will also empower the use of distributed ledger technology as-a-service offering builders and businesses more granular options when customizing our solutions to achieve their desired degree of web3 exposures. We are going to make it cheaper and easier to build cryptographically native storage applications.

## **The Basics of Shadow Cloud**

The Shadow Ecosystem is a series of trustless infrastructure layers focused on decentralizing the web2 stack and adapting it for the web3 world. We call this core technology D.A.G.G.E.R. Powered by Shadow Operators, the network provides builders and businesses with storage and compute solutions to expand their web3 presence, or simply use some of the most highly performant distributed ledger technology for it's low cost and resiliency in business.

Now cloud compute makes up $400,000,000,000 (that's billion with a B) per year business, and is expected to increase by another $1T by 2030.

The Shadow Platform is a stable high-performance cloud platform powered by a decentralized network of operators. Unlike traditional cloud platforms, network-generated revenues are sent to Shadow Operators. Shadow is the only commodity cloud network designed to democratize the hundreds of billions earned each year by traditional cloud platforms without sacrificing performance.

In order execute this trustless decentralized network we built our own highly performant consensus and orchestration protocol called D.A.G.G.E.R.

## **D.A.G.G.E.R.**

The foundation the Shadow Ecosystem is D.A.G.G.E.R., a trustless decentralized consensus protocol that expands the Shadow Cloud platform beyond standard compute and storage offerings, enabling decentralized offerings of compute, mobile compute, and decentralized storage - all while pushing the limits of performance, quality, and security. D.A.G.G.E.R. stands for Directed Acyclic Gossip Graph Enabling Replication (of compute and storage).

## **Storage**

Shadow Drive takes open source software-defined object storage and integrates it with Solana’s Proof of History consensus mechanism, and then decentralizes it. This allows it to achieve extremely fast I/O speeds, massive scalability, and data integrity. At the same time it retains the benefits of the trustlessness, enhanced security, full transparency, and decentralization that blockchain technology brings to the table.

Ultimately, Shadow Drive’s implementation of D.A.G.G.E.R. will produce a permissionless, trustless, decentralized distributed storage network that exists in perpetuity without needing to rely on the direct efforts of a centralized team to grow and expand. It will take time, as the path for open sourcing hardware infrastructure is different from that for software, but Shadow Drive’s final form will be one in which the community drives the direction, enhancements, and future of Shadow Drive.

The current [design](./) of Shadow Drive makes embedding storage into applications easy, robust, and natively integrated into the Solana blockchain. Use Shadow Drive to store your 800gb model weights, 100 TB training data and all the generated images your users generate via our [Python](SDK/). Or maybe you just want to store your historical geyser plugin output and state, and any relevant program accounts and transactions. If your are building an application in need of back-end storage, secondary storage, or client-facing storage option then our robust [Javascript SDK](./) has you covered. For all use cases, we are focused on making fast and reliable storage incredibly easy to build with.

## **Compute**

Utilizing DAGGER as an orchestration / oracle protocol, we are capable of networking together decentralized commodity clouds (Shadow Operator virtual machines) under a frond end UI/UX experience that effectively decentralizes virtual machine provisioning. This is similar in concept as an Amazon EC2 instances, or Digital Ocean Droplets, except the back end resources and "network stack" are owned and operates trustlessly by individuals / entities who are Shadow Operators! This is currently in proof-of-concept and under development for the future. We revealed this technology as the Solana Breakpoint 2022 event.

## **Shadow Operators**

**(currently in private alpha)**

Shadow Operators are the decentralized backbone of the Shadow commodity cloud. Operators lease their high-performance compute, storage, and bandwidth. Businesses, projects, and/or individual developers can trustlessly provision network resources. User payments are sent directly to Shadow Operators. Shadow Operators who ensure their resources are always available and performant earn more. Shadow Operators who are inconsistent earn less.

At the foundation of everything are the Shadow Operators who run the nodes that power the Shadow Platform. Operators can connect new nodes to the network, manage their existing servers, or view the overall status of other Shadow Operators – all through the one easy-to-use portal.

Currently in development are a series of Shadow Operator node roles including resolvers, ingestors, storers, cachers. These roles work together under the orchestration of DAGGER to form a permissionless distributed platform that support both Shadow Cloud services and mobile storage being developed.

## **Roadmap**

There are three areas we focus our developments:

* The Shadow Drive implementation of DAGGER
* The Mobile implementation of DAGGER and Shadow Drive
* The combination of the above two to support AI evolution

## **Putting it all together**

"On-chain" versus "off-chain" is a concept that needs to evolve in order for #web3 tech to meaningfully gain user adoption. #blockchain is type of decentralized ledger technology, but it's not the only DLT anymore. "On-DLT" versus "off-DLT", that's what matters. This is not to take away from the significance of #blockchain or its impact on the world. Instead, it's merely to say that the subset of technologies falling under the DTL umbrella has expanded in the 14 years since blockchain first appeared. The right tool for the right job matters.

Our hope is that Shadow Cloud and D.A.G.G.E.R represent a first step on the path to creating composability in Web3. Not just composability between one blockchain and another... instead, zoom out and think about composability between different all systems under the DLT umbrella. By creating interoperability between Solana and DAGGER the result is a true Web3 cloud platform that doesn't sacrifice speed, stability, and/or security in order to gain trustlessness, decentralization, permissionlessness, and/or censorship resistance.

Decentralized Ledger Technology should be thought of as a superset of technologies that can be selected and assembled in various combinations to satisfy specific user requirements. So what are some of these user requirements? Here are some real world use cases to start:
