# **Shadow Cloud**

## **Mission**

The Shadow Platform will continually evolve as a stable high-performance cloud platform powered by a decentralized network of operators. Shadow is the only commodity cloud network designed to democratize the hundreds of billions earned each year by traditional cloud platforms without sacrificing performance. Through thoughtful design, the Shadow Cloud will offer multiple service options which leverage our distributed ledger technology. The result is vertically integrated, L1-specific storage/compute greatly improving developer experience. This will also empower the use of distributed ledger technology as-a-service offering builders and businesses more granular options when customizing our solutions to achieve their desired degree of web3 exposures. 

## **The Basics of Shadow Cloud**
The Shadow Ecosystem is a series of trustless infrastructure layers focused on decentralizing the web2 stack and adapting it for the web3 world. We call this core technology D.A.G.G.E.R. Powered by Shadow Operators, the network provides builders and businesses with storage and compute solutions to expand their web3 presence, or simply use some of the most highly performant distributed ledger technology for it's low cost and resiliency in business.

Now cloud compute makes up $400,000,000,000 (that's billion with a B) per year business, and is expected to increase by another $1T by 2030.

The Shadow Platform is a stable high-performance cloud platform powered by a decentralized network of operators. Unlike traditional cloud platforms, network-generated revenues are sent to Shadow Operators. Shadow is the only commodity cloud network designed to democratize the hundreds of billions earned each year by traditional cloud platforms without sacrificing performance.

In order execute this trustless decentralized network we built our own highly performant consensus and orchestration protocol called D.A.G.G.E.R.

## **D.A.G.G.E.R.**
The foundation the Shadow Ecosystem is D.A.G.G.E.R., a trustless decentralized consensus protocol that expands the Shadow Cloud platform beyond standard compute and storage offerings, enabling decentralized offerings of compute, mobile compute, and decentralized storage - all while pushing the limits of performance, quality, and security. D.A.G.G.E.R. stands for Directed Acyclic Gossip Graph Enabling Replication (of compute and storage).

## **Storage**
Shadow Drive takes open source software-defined object storage and integrates it with Solana’s Proof of History consensus mechanism, and then decentralizes it. This allows it to achieve extremely fast I/O speeds, massive scalability, and data integrity. At the same time it retains the benefits of the trustlessness, enhanced security, full transparency, and decentralization that blockchain technology brings to the table.

Ultimately, Shadow Drive’s implementation of D.A.G.G.E.R. will produce a permissionless, trustless, decentralized distributed storage network that exists in perpetuity without needing to rely on the direct efforts of a centralized team to grow and expand. It will take time, as the path for open sourcing hardware infrastructure is different from that for software, but Shadow Drive’s final form will be one in which the community drives the direction, enhancements, and future of Shadow Drive.

## **Compute**
Built on a network of independent operators, Shadow’s Solana RPCs truly decentralize your back-end API with payments for compute going directly to ecosystem operators. Upgrade your back-end API to fit a Web3 ethos while still benefiting from resiliency, performance, and affordability.

Utilizing DAGGER as an orchestration / oracle protocol, we are capable of networking together decentralized commodity clouds (Shadow Operator virtual machines) under a frond end UI/UX experience that effectively decentralizes virtual machine provisioning. This is the same as Amazon EC2 instances, or Digital Ocean Droplets, except the back end resources and "network stack" are owned and operates trustlessly by individuals / entities who are Shadow Operators! This is currently in proof-of-concept and under development for the future. We revealed this technology as the Solana Breakpoint 2022 event.

## **Shadow Operators**
Shadow Operators are the decentralized backbone of the Shadow commodity cloud. Operators lease their high-performance compute, storage, and bandwidth. Businesses, projects, and/or individual developers can trustlessly provision network resources. User payments are sent directly to Shadow Operators. Shadow Operators who ensure their resources are always available and performant earn more. Shadow Operators who are inconsistent earn less.

At the foundation of everything are the Shadow Operators who run the nodes that power the Shadow Platform. Operators can connect new nodes to the network, manage their existing servers, or view the overall status of other Shadow Operators – all through the one easy-to-use portal.

## **Business Use Cases for Shadow Cloud**
<details><summary>Storage Use Cases</summary>

* Storage
    * Web hosting & content management
        * Managing static content at high volumes that can elastically scale with your needs makes Shadow Drive a great solution for web content, media, images, and other unstructured data types.
    * Social media
        * Temporarily or permanently store message history and embedded media, stream video content from user uploads, and store and deliver vast amounts of images and avatars to enhance the Web3 efficacy of your app.
    * Archival & back-up
        * By 3x replicating and erasure coding encrypted records across a decentralized network, Shadow Drive can preserve valuable records from bad actors.
    * Datasets
        * Some information is too important for humanity to lose. From scientific research projects to historical documentation, cryptographic proofs guarantee a dataset’s integrity and availability forever. Imagine if the world’s most important libraries couldn’t be destroyed because the information has been distributed across thousands of unique locations worldwide.
    * Personal & editable storage space
        * With optional mutability, you are free to create and delete files as you see fit. With low costs and many front-end user interfaces to choose from, Shadow Drive can be your personal expanded storage space.
