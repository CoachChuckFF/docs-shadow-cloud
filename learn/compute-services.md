### **The Shadow VM implementation of DAGGER**

Utilizing DAGGER as an consensus-driven server orchestration protocol, we are capable of networking together decentralized commodity clouds (Shadow Operator virtual machines on micro-clouds) under a frond end UI/UX experience that effectively decentralizes virtual machine provisioning. This is similar in concept as Amazon EC2 instances, or Digital Ocean Droplets, except the back end resources and "network stack" are owned and operates trustlessly by individuals / entities who are Shadow Operators! This is currently in proof-of-concept and under development for the future deployment. We are have not set a release date. We revealed this technology at the Solana Breakpoint 2022 event.

### **The Mobile implementation of DAGGER + Shadow Drive**

With our recent success in recompiling DAGGER on the Solana Saga mobile platform, our roadmap now includes the deployment of DAGGER to mobile devices, which will bring fast Layer-2 finality across mobile peers and deeper integration with Shadow Drive + Solana Mobile for our builders.

By leveraging the power of mobile resources spread across the globe, the convergence of DAGGER technology with the Shadow Platform will position us well for emerging trends such as "data-as-code," AI-edge apps, and the monetization of idle latent resources by mobile users. This will enable us to stay ahead of the curve and provide our users with cutting-edge technology for their building needs. This project remains in very early stage development and a release date has yet to be determined.
