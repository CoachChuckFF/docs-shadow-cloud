### **The Shadow VM implementation of DAGGER**
Utilizing DAGGER as an consensus-driven server orchestration protocol, we are capable of networking together decentralized commodity clouds (Shadow Operator virtual machines on micro-clouds) under a frond end UI/UX experience that effectively decentralizes virtual machine provisioning. This is similar in concept as Amazon EC2 instances, or Digital Ocean Droplets, except the back end resources and "network stack" are owned and operates trustlessly by individuals / entities who are Shadow Operators! This is currently in proof-of-concept and under development for the future. We revealed this technology as the Solana Breakpoint 2022 event.

### **The Mobile implementation of DAGGER + Shadow Drive**
Having successfully recompiled DAGGER on the Solana Saga (Android) mobile, we have included in our roadmap the eventual deployment of DAGGER TO mobile brining with it fast consensus finality across mobile peers and bootstrapping deeper Shadow Drive mobile integration for our builders. The convergency of powerful mobile resources spread across the world with DAGGER technology will position the Shadow Platform well for growing themes such as "data-as-code," AI-edge apps, and idle latent resources that mobile users can monetize.
