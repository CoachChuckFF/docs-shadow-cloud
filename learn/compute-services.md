# **Compute Services**

Utilizing DAGGER as an orchestration / oracle protocol, we are capable of networking together decentralized commodity clouds (Shadow Operator virtual machines) under a frond end UI/UX experience that effectively decentralizes virtual machine provisioning. This is similar in concept as Amazon EC2 instances, or Digital Ocean Droplets, except the back end resources and "network stack" are owned and operates trustlessly by individuals / entities who are Shadow Operators! This is currently in proof-of-concept and under development for the future. We revealed this technology as the Solana Breakpoint 2022 event.

## **The Cloud Orchestration Implementation of DAGGER**

discuss on a high level how VMs are trustlessly provisioned from operators via DAGGER and what the means for dagger as decentralized orchestration engine capable of handling any resource through any API. discuss how akin to an oracle this is, and the frontier of mobile compute and supporting trustless automation for AI frontier.
