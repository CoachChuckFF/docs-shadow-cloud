### **The Shadow VM implementation of D.A.G.G.E.R.**

As we continue to push the boundaries of cloud computing, we have developed a revolutionary solution that utilizes _D.A.G.G.E.R._ as a consensus-driven server orchestration protocol. With this technology, we are able to network together decentralized commodity clouds, specifically Shadow Operator virtual machines on micro-clouds, under a user-friendly front-end UI/UX experience. This effectively decentralizes virtual machine provisioning. These virtual machines are similar in concept to the popular cloud providers options like Amazon EC2 instances or Digital Ocean Droplets. However, the back-end resources and "network stack" are owned and operated trustlessly by individuals/entities who are Shadow Operators.

With the ability to effectively decentralize virtual machine provisioning, Shadow Operators have the power to revolutionize the cloud computing industry by providing a more secure, transparent, and efficient solution for users. This technology has the potential to disrupt traditional cloud providers and empower individuals/entities to take control of their cloud resources. We are excited to continue pushing the boundaries of cloud computing with this groundbreaking technology.

This proof-of-concept technology is currently under development for future deployment, and we have yet to set a release date. Our recent unveiling of this technology at the Solana Breakpoint 2022 event has generated significant buzz and excitement within the industry.

### **The Mobile implementation of D.A.G.G.E.R. + Shadow Drive v2**

With our recent success in recompiling _D.A.G.G.E.R._ on the Solana Saga mobile platform, our roadmap now includes the deployment of _D.A.G.G.E.R._ to mobile devices, which will bring fast Layer-2 finality across mobile peers and deeper integration with Shadow Drive + Solana Mobile for our builders.

By leveraging the power of mobile resources spread across the globe, the convergence of _D.A.G.G.E.R._ technology with the Shadow Platform will position us well for emerging trends such as "data-as-code," AI-edge apps, and the monetization of idle latent resources by mobile users. This will enable us to stay ahead of the curve and provide our users with cutting-edge technology for their building needs. This project remains in very early stage development and a release date has yet to be determined.
